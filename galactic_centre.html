					<h2> Star formation in the Galactic Centre  </h2></p>
					<h3> Molecular gas kinematics within the inner 250 pc of the Milky Way  </h3></p>

					<div id="mainfig2" class="right">
					<p align="justify">
					</p>
					<p align="justify"> The ultimate goal of star formation research is to develop an end-to-end
															understanding of stellar mass assembly as a function of environment.
															The central molecular zone of our Galaxy (CMZ; i.e. the inner few hundred
															parsecs) hosts some of the most extreme products of the SF process.
															These include massive star clusters (e.g. the Arches and Quintuplet),
															massive star-forming protocluster clouds (e.g. Sgr B2), and massive quiescent
															infrared dark clouds (e.g. G0.253+0.016, A.K.A “the Brick”). However,
															in spite of this, and despite containing ~80% per cent of the Galaxy’s
															dense gas, the global present-day SF rate is about 10-100x below
															what is expected given this vast reservoir of dense material.
					</p>
					<p align="justify"> Star formation within this complex environment may be closely linked to the
						                  orbital dynamics of the gas. Observational studies of some of the CMZ’s most
															massive and dense molecular clouds (a region of the CMZ known as the “dust ridge”),
															led to suggestions that their embedded star formation may follow an evolutionary
															sequence. In this interpretation, star formation is triggered following the
															compression of the gas clouds as they make their closest approach to the bottom
															of the Galactic potential well during their orbit. Verifying such a scenario
															necessitates obtaining an accurate, holistic understanding of the gas kinematics and
															distribution - something which has been sought after for several decades.

					<div id="main2" class="left">
					<p align="justify"> Prior to 2016, the kinematics of the CMZ had been described using a combination
															of position-velocity diagrams, channel maps, and moment analysis. Unfortunately
															however, although such techniques are simple to implement and well-understood,
															their output can be subjective and easily misinterpreted in complex environments.
															With this in mind, we developed SCOUSE - a unique line-analysis tool designed
															to accurately extract the kinematics of star forming regions. I used SCOUSE to
															perform a comprehensive decomposition of the kinematics of the CMZ (see Fig. 1).
															Comparing with theoretical models for the orbital geometry this is now helping
															to constrain the 3D structure of the gas and helping us to understand the initial
															condtions for star formation in this complex environment. Moreover, In demonstrating
															that the dust ridge clouds belong to a single coherent gas stream, this work
															also confirmed the plausibility that	these clouds follow an evolutionary sequence.

          <div id="main2" class="left">
					<p align="justify"> My study of the CMZ gas kinematics has also prompted new questions,
                              for instance, is it reasonable to assume that the dust ridge clouds had
                              similar initial conditions, such that the tidal compression at pericentre
                              causes them to evolve and form stars on similar time-scales? To answer this
                              question, we investigated the gas situated upstream from pericentre.
                              I identified line-of-sight velocity corrugations as a function of Galactic
                              longitude in this upstream gas. At the velocity extremes, the gas stream hosts
                              compact (R ~ 2pc) cloud condensations with masses of ~10000 solar masses, that are
                              quasi-regularly spaced with a separation of ~10 pc. The wavelength of the
                              velocity corrugations and the separation of the clouds closely match the predicted
                              Toomre length and Jeans length, respectivley. This led me to suggest that molecular
                              clouds within the gas stream may form via  gravitational instabilities. The similar
                              spacing of the dust ridge clouds (~12 pc) suggests these clouds may formed in the
                              same way. Situated upstream from pericentre, the newly identified condensations,
                              with no signatures of star formation activity, may reflect historical analogues to the dust
                              ridge clouds - and therefore progenitors of some of the most massive and dense
                              molecular clouds in the Galaxy. If confirmed, these clouds may pinpoint the initial
                              phases of star formation; the beginning of an evolutionary sequence that we can follow, as a
                              function of time, from cloud condensation to star formation.
